# BinarySearchTree
Visual (WIP) Binary Search Tree

This is a simple c# binary search tree implementation. It currently contains one scene, "RuntimeBinarySearchTree" which creates a tree and prints it in the correct order.

I also use Unity Test Runner to demonstrate Unit Testing practices in Unity and test the tree implementation.
To run the tests select Window -> General -> Test Runner, and select "Run All".

Interactive implementation coming soon!
